**COM & SID static persistence detection ‚Äî one repo, two tools (free).**  
Windows-focused, offline-friendly, strict static checks first. Optional VT/AI only **when you choose**.

## Tools Included

- **LutziCOMLyzer - Advanced Persistence Detector** (`LutziCheckSuspiciousCOM.py`)  
  Deep forensic scanner for COM, WinRT, and indirect persistence vectors.  
  ‚Ä¢ Performs multi-layer validation: existence, signature, trusted path, ownership, dispatch test, hash matching.  
  ‚Ä¢ Detects orphaned/broken CLSIDs, Active Setup/Winsock persistence, and stealth COM-based persistence.  
  ‚Ä¢ Optional integration with VirusTotal and AI reasoning for high-confidence threat classification.  

- **LutziSIDHunter - Advanced Terminator THreats** (`tt7.ps1`)  
  Advanced registry/SID/ACL forensic utility.  
  ‚Ä¢ Scans live or offline hives for anomalous or malicious SIDs.  
  ‚Ä¢ Repairs ACLs, removes persistence keys, and backs up/restores registry hives.  
  ‚Ä¢ Supports writing cleaned hives back to the system and verifying post-install clean state.  
  ‚Ä¢ Includes optional download/burn of clean Windows ISOs for secure rebuilds.

## ‚ú® What it does
- **Static first:** file existence, Authenticode signature, trusted-path / allowlist checks.
- **Focused scope:** COM CLSIDs & common indirect persistence surfaces; SID/ACL anomalies.
- **Offline/Safe Mode friendly:** designed to run without ‚Äútickling‚Äù persistence.
- **Operator-controlled escalation:** *only if an entry remains suspicious* you can opt-in to:
  - **VirusTotal** lookup (requires your API key)
  - **AI reasoning** summary (requires your API key)
- **Runtime:** a full deep scan can take **~4 hours** on big systems ‚Äî be patient.
- **Output:** CSV/JSON **only when you ask for export** (no endless auto-logging).

## üîß Requirements
> ‚Ä¢ **LutziCOMLyzer**  (Python)

  - **Windows 7/8/10/11

  - **Python 3.8.6+

  - **PowerShell available in PATH (for signature checks on Windows)

  - **(Optional) VirusTotal / AI keys if you choose those paths

> ‚Ä¢ **TT7** (PowerShell)

  - **Windows 10/11, Admin recommended

  - **PowerShell 5.1+ (or 7+), Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force when running locally

  - **VSS optional if you want to snapshot locked hives
---
## üóÇ Outputs (on demand)

- **  LutziCOMLyzer: com_scan.csv (CLSID, path, exists, signed, trusted, hash, notes).
- **  Optional: reasoning snippets when you used AI, VT verdict when you used VT.

- **  TT7: services.csv/json, tasks.csv/json, com_hotspots.csv/json, ifeo.csv/json, appcontainer.csv/json, acl_report.csv/json (names may vary by your flags).

- **  By design, there is no continuous auto-logging. You decide when to export.
---
##‚öôÔ∏è Allow/deny lists

  - ** The tool uses trusted paths and signer allowlists (built-in + yours).

  - ** You can extend with your own whitelist / blacklist concepts (e.g., based on LOKI or your org‚Äôs intel).
this is actually for first, should update loki db and more relevant, then continue to scan and detection steps.
  - ** Anything whitelisted is never sent to VT/AI.

##üõ° Safety & ethics

  - **For defensive use on systems you own or are authorized to analyze.

  - **No destructive actions are included by default.

  - **Do not send samples or ‚Äúlive malware‚Äù to me. This repo is not a dropbox or a lab service.

##‚ùìSupport & feedback

- **Found a bug? Have a feature request?
- **Open an Issue on the repo with steps to reproduce and sanitized logs if possible.

- **For collaboration ideas: use GitHub Issues/Discussions.
---
## üß≠ When to use it
- Suspect a **stubborn persistence** returning after cleanup.
- Need a **static, explainable** triage (no secret black magic).
- Preparing for **firmware-level checks** (Intel ME / SPI flash) if software-level is clean but persistence returns.

> **Heads up (future docs):** if persistence keeps coming back, check Intel ME and consider SPI flash reprogramming with a clean BIOS image. A simple ME guide + SPI walk-through will be added later.
---

## Quick Start
### 1) LutziCOMLyzer
# from an elevated cmd/powershell in the repo folder
python LutziCheckSuspiciousCOM.py ^
  --mode strict ^
  --export out\com_scan.csv


 ## Notes

  - ** mode strict = escalate only if static checks still point suspicious.

 - ** On a big machine, expect ~4 hours for a deep pass.

 - ** If something survives the static filters, the tool will ask you whether to run VT and/or AI.
 - ** Nothing is sent anywhere unless you choose it and provide keys.

### 2) TT7
# from an elevated PowerShell in the repo folder
- ** Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
- ** .\tt7.ps1 -OutDir "C:\Temp\TT7_Out" -ReadOnly

Notes

  -ReadOnly is the default mindset: enumerate, don‚Äôt modify.

- **  Add -UseVSS if you want to snapshot and copy locked hives safely.

- ** Output CSV/JSON/XML only if you request it via flags inside the script.
